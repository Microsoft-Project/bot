# labelling-bot
LabelBot is a Github application that can be used to automatically tag an issue with a Github label.
It uses machine learning to read the comment body and title to estimate what the issue might be about, and then labels the issue following the publishing of a short comment notifying the issue creator of the same.

When an issue is opened, the bot predicts if the label should be a:
`üêû bug`, `üí° enhancement` or `? question` and applies it automatically if appropriate.

## Setup

```sh
# Install dependencies
yarn install or npm install

# Run the bot
yarn start or npm start
```

## Docker

```sh
# 1. Build container
docker build -t labelling-bot .

# 2. Start container
docker run -e APP_ID=<app-id> -e PRIVATE_KEY=<pem-value> labelling-bot
```
